we want a number of perceptual phenomena clumps
each pressed up against the others
each clump more or less blobby-round. Graphically cohesive and unified.
Also, we can't have clumps blocking each other from growth

we could have each clump be a rectangle. And new blocks appear thoough subdividing that sense-rectangle

########################################
A NEW GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION METHOD
########################################

all events are respresented by a hexagonal tile. 
Simple. All the same size

Type is denoted via a heiroglyph
Type is also denoted by color
red=sound, yellow=sight, brown=thought... or somesuch

intensity is denoted via color 
weaker=pasteller, unto white for no intensity (intensity over the ambient, that is. Is the empty space just a mash of undiffewrentiated perceptual noise? No, there is no emptiness. The emptiness is invisible)

This intensity-rendering works graphically fine for fading-in-out sounds and such too.

PLACEMENT

Each type of perceptual event hexagon (PEH) groys within a cone projecting outward from the center.

Like this

first PEH (peh0) is placed in the center
growth cone for peh0 is specified . 
Direction=random
Span = 2PI/totalnumberofpehtypes

second (peh1) is placed at arbitrary one of the six faces of the first PEH
third.
if it is of different type from peh0 then geometrically appropriate growth cone is selected, within set of pieslices 
implied by the first peh.

third (peh2) is placed, either grouping or establshing new slice

and so on
