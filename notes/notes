we want a number of perceptual phenomena clumps
each pressed up against the others
each clump more or less blobby-round. Graphically cohesive and unified.
Also, we can't have clumps blocking each other from growth

we could have each clump be a rectangle. And new blocks appear thoough subdividing that sense-rectangle

sight
sound
thought
smell
taste
touch
strange feelings

A NEW GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION METHOD
########################################

all events are respresented by a hexagonal tile. 
Simple. All the same size

Type is denoted via a heiroglyph
Type is also denoted by color
red=sound, yellow=sight, brown=thought... or somesuch

intensity is denoted via color 
weaker=pasteller, unto white for no intensity (intensity over the ambient, that is. Is the empty space just a mash of undiffewrentiated perceptual noise? No, there is no emptiness. The emptiness is invisible)

This intensity-rendering works graphically fine for fading-in-out sounds and such too.
