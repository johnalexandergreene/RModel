ZCELLSYSTEM

It's a system of cells.
each cell can hold an arbitrary number of presences, each with an arbitrary intensity level
presence is the presence of a polygon. Where is the polygon relative to the cell.
A presence object has 
  a polygon (the polygon that is present)
  a value in range [0,1] (how present) 

If the cell is well inside the polygon then that polygon has presence=1 for that cell
If the cell is well outside the polygon, presence=0? 
Near the edge but inside : 0<presence<0.5
